This note gives a concise introduction to Dung's abstract argumentation theory \cite{Dun1995} and  some extensions (probabilistic extension, in particular).
% 
We mainly investigate Dung's original notions of complete, grounded, preferred, and stable semantics. 
However, 
for other semantics which are available in the literature since Ding's seminal work \cite{Dun1995}, 
for instance, 
semi-stable, ideal, eager, stage, CF2 and stage2 semantics \cite{Bar.Gia2009, Bar.Cam.Gia2018}, 
will be considered in the next version of this note.
